# 🏨 Data Analysis – Hospitality Domain  
### A Data Analytics project by [Mohd Bilal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bilal-mohd)

## 🚀 Project Overview  
In the competitive hospitality industry, data-driven insights can give hotels a strong edge.  
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on hotel booking & occupancy data to derive actionable business insights.  
The goal: uncover trends in occupancy, revenue, room-type performance, cancellation behaviour, and more — supporting strategic decision-making for a hotel chain.

## 🧩 What This Project Demonstrates  
✅ End-to-end data analytics workflow  
✅ Data cleaning, transformation & feature creation  
✅ Exploratory visualisation using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn)  
✅ KPIs like occupancy rate, RevPAR, ADR, cancellation rate  
✅ Business-facing insights with strong storytelling

## 🧠 Technical Workflow  
### 1️⃣ Data Exploration  
- Loaded booking, room & hotel metadata — reviewed distributions, missing values, and outliers.  
- Investigated key dimensions: city, room class, booking platform, time (weekday/weekend).  
### 2️⃣ Data Transformation  
- Derived new metrics like **Occupancy %**, **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**, **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**.  
- Encoded categorical variables, handled missing or inconsistent data.  
### 3️⃣ Insight Generation  
- Visualised performance across dimensions (city, room class, time).  
- Focused on business questions:  
  - Which cities/room types yield the highest revenue or occupancy?  
  - Where are cancellations highest and how to mitigate?  
  - Weekday vs weekend performance differences.  
### 4️⃣ Business Outcomes  
- Delivered clear visuals and actionable recommendations for hotel management.  
- Showcased how data-driven decisions can boost occupancy, optimise pricing, and reduce cancellations.

## 💡 Key Achievements  
- Completed full data analysis workflow with real business context.  
- Highlighted top-performing cities and room classes, and identified under-performers/needing attention.  
- Combined data analytics skills with domain knowledge (hospitality KPIs).  
- Prepared results suitable for stakeholders — not just “code output” but business storytelling.

## 🧾 Business Relevance  
This project simulates a **real-world hospitality business challenge**: improving revenue and occupancy across hotels under pressure from competition.  
It demonstrates how **analytics can support strategic decisions** like pricing, room class mix, cancellation policies, and platform channel management.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Introduce predictive modelling (e.g., forecast occupancy or cancellations).  
🔹 Expand dataset with more variables (customer demographics, booking lead time, loyalty status).  
🔹 Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Power BI) for stakeholders.  
🔹 Develop automation for data updates and periodic reporting.
