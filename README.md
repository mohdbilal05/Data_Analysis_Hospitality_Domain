🏨 Hospitality Data Analysis using Python
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hospitality dataset to uncover business insights, identify patterns, and support data-driven decision making. Insights are focused on booking trends, revenue optimization, customer behavior, and operational efficiency within the hospitality industry.

🚀 Project Overview
In today’s competitive hospitality market, businesses must leverage data to stay profitable and optimize resources. This notebook explores operational challenges such as:
✅ High cancellation rates
✅ Unbalanced revenue streams
✅ Seasonal performance fluctuations
✅ Factors affecting average daily rate (ADR) and guest retention
The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, descriptive analytics, and visual exploration using Python.

🎯 Business Insights
These are some examples of insights derived from the analysis:
•	City hotels face higher cancellation rates than resort hotels.
•	Longer lead times are strongly correlated with cancellations.
•	Repeat guests contribute to stable revenue and lower cancellation risk.
•	Bookings through agents or corporate channels have different ADR patterns.
•	Peak season months generate higher revenue but also higher cancellations.
